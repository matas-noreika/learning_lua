# Introduction
Hello and welcome to my journey on learning to develop with lua.
I have had used lua in the past through Roblox game development but always wandered how do I do it with the shell.
In this repository I aim to explore interesting features and possibilities with lua.

# Prerequisites
As all development environments you require a few bits and pieces to get things going.
1. Get yourself a text editor (not and IDE😈)
2. Using your package manager (assuming a linux/MacOS platform) install lua 
## MacOS
`brew install lua`
## Linux
`sudo apt install lua` (you might be using a different package manager from apt)
That's it now you are ready to try out the sample program in hello-world/
